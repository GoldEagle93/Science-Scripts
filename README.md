# Science-Scripts
Some scripts I wrote for research. Here are some details of what they do:

water-residence.py:
It calculates the time a water molecule was withing a threshold from a specific region of another molecule.

prepare-for-casp.py:
It reformats the outputs of our clustering protocol into a multi-model pdb file which is formatted based on the casp template.
